# Product Review Summarization

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/amazon-product-reviews

## Description
The project aims to summarize customer reviews for products listed on any e-commmerce website with the help of generative loops.  I have combined vector database functionality for efficient data storage with OpenAI's LLM embedding generation capabilities to help create embeddings and then generate a descriptive summary of user experience for the product.

## Example
