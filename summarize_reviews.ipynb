Some customers enjoy the unique licorice flavor and find it refreshing, while others are disappointed by the lack of bergamot aroma and flavor typically associated with Earl Grey tea. Those who appreciate the organic and natural ingredients highly recommend this tea, praising its distinct and floral taste. Some customers even claim it is the best Earl Grey they have ever tried, with a smooth and heavy texture that leaves a lasting impression. However, those seeking a traditional Earl Grey experience may be let down by the deviation from the classic flavor profile.\"}]}}}"

It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that\\'s all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat. It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste. If you like lime, you\\'ll love this tea. If you don\\'t like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense \"lime experience\". I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes: \"From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you\\'ll fall in love with it!\"<br /><br />If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won\\'t be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. In fact, I have never heard of anyone else making this tea. I enjoy serving it to company, but even more, just for me.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****'},\n",

After having hot tea at several Chinese restaurants, I was amazed to learn, all tea isn\\'t sweet iced tea! :)<br />My quest for the perfect cup of tea thus began!<br /><br /> In the past 2 years I have ordered every type of tea imaginable & have came across quite a few nice teas.. I have learned some that smell wonderful taste drab & some that smell drab taste wonderful.. I just recently came across Numi teas, while trying to find a company that made rose tea (which Numi does & I have to tell you, it\\'s a very delightful tea, which was sinfully delicious when brewed with jasmine).<br /><br />I ordered the Numi Dry Desert Lime on a whim... I had never heard of such a tea & although I have never enjoyed lemon tea, I love lemonade & lime drinks, so I thought why not? That was the BEST decision I have made in a long time! It is NOTHING like \"tea with lemon\", as the package states, it is 100% desert lime. It is wonderful hot & very refreshing cold. I never add more than a occasional dash of honey to my hot teas, but I have to admit to adding one pack of splenda to this tea.. It created the perfect blend of \"sweet & sour\". I gave a cup to my mom & she preferred it plain, so try it out both ways, as well as hot & cold! I absolutely adore this tea & will be ordering it again very soon!'},\n",

It's aroma is mild, but it's flavor is amazingly refreshing, a citrus treat.<br /><br />I'm not especially fond of sour tastes, I normally need extra sugar and ice in my lemonade, and many herb teas turn me off for their strong sour flavor (possibly the hibiscus?).  Pleasantly, and inexplicably, this Numi Lime tisane delivers bright, tart flavor that is somehow mellowed and without the unwanted burning aftertaste of so many other citrus beverages.<br /><br />Above and beyond the rich lime-juice flavor is this amazing light and exotic aftertaste - I can only suppose it's a product of fermenting and drying the lime peels.  It is an earthy, misty and mysterious flavor, but as odd as it is, it is also ephemeral and fleeting. Just a hint of a chergui in your teacup, if you allow your imagination to draw it out.<br /><br />I've tried Numi Dry Desert Lime with stevia, with honey, with agave, but I confess my favorite is to add only a pinch of demerara raw sugar.  Iced is so refreshing, warm is fortifying.  Great stuff!  I may never touch a hibiscus-based tisane again.\"},\n",
